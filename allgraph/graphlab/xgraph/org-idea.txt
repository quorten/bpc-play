Okay, I'm at the point where I should create a general math library,
but better broken up into subject categories.

What main categories of math are there?

* "Necessary evil" integer data format conversions: byte swap, bit
  swap.

* Integer scalar math primitives, basic 2D math: add, subtract,
  multiply, divide, modulus, divide-modulus, multiply-divide, shift
  left, asymmetric truncate shift right, absolute value, min, max.

  Swap?  Maybe, show both swap in place and swap with temp variable.

* Integer scalar math primitives, advanced 2D/3D math: symmetric
  truncate shift right, multiply-shift right, shift left-divide, find
  first set, find last set, square root, approximate square root (2
  levels), inverse square root, inverse approximate square root (2
  levels).

* Logarithms: Compute number e, compute tables of logarithms for
  fixed-point, maybe even adding support for generating floating point
  tables of logarithms.

* 2D graphics drawing math primitives.  Line, circle, ellipse,
  and polynomial curve iterators.

* 2D GUI implementation math primitives.  Graphics hit testing.

* Square matrix and point vector math.

* Geometric equation solvers.

* Audio frequency analysis and related math primitives.  JPEG
  compression/decompression, maybe even MPEG codecs.
