Okay, I'm at the point where I should create a general math library,
but better broken up into subject categories.

What main categories of math are there?

* 2D graphics drawing math primitives.  Line, circle, ellipse,
  and polynomial curve iterators.

* 2D GUI implementation math primitives.  Graphics hit testing.

* Square matrix and point vector math.

* Geometric equation solvers.

* Audio frequency analysis and related math primitives.
