/* Structured file organizer interface - Extended editing
   functionality of any file with structure.  Usually, source code
   files for computer programs are just plain text files.  Depending
   on the editor you use, you may have features which help you when
   fetching symbol names for your program, but for reusing ideas from
   previous programs as a micro addition to your program, such editors
   don't make it that much easier.  This interface provides an easily
   editable hierarchy of conditional features of a computer program
   once the metadata is filled out. */
