The fact that the code is comprised about several major level modules
does not mean that each module is independent of each other.  However,
the majority of the functions and data structures are encapsulated
into such modules, and each module is accessed from the other only by
clean and well-defined interfaces.  When defining the interfaces, care
must be taken to make sure the interfaces are programmer friendly.

Interfaces can be installed into modules so that one module depends on
another.
