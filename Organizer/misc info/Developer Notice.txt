We are almost doing really well, except for the fact that we aren't. We are almost there, but not quite. We are travelers on a road, and we have not yet reached our destination.

"We are programmers." We embark on a journey to improve your working conditions. We meet many obstacles on our pelirious quest. There are even times when it seems we are doomed to failure. Yet wet commit ourselves to the problem at hand, and reach our destination triumphantly. For it takes great determination to achieve great success, and that is the determination that us fellow free software developers put forth.

"Support the free software movement." Supporting our movement first and foremost means education: that all users of free software understand the free software philosophy. If we do not talk about freedom, how can we expect it to last? It is for this reason that the first and formost important way of supporting free software is to build awareness for the users of free software.

Do not let the results of hard work and determination fade away. It is in everyone's responsibility to maintain a community, not just the officials. If you just go away from reading this like you've just read a newspaper, you will not fulfull your community responsibility, and freedom will be lost. Therefore, please go to at least one person whom you know in common who uses free software, free as in freedom, and if there is just one favor you can do for them, tell them the truth: that they have the permission use, permission to modify, and permission to distribute their software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, that their software is created in the spirit of freedom, the spirit that does not mandate owners to software, that that they not only know that they have all these rights, but that they also understand the free software philosophy to the point of becoming a member of the free software community.
