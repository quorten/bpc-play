This is how the physical record manager should work:
Name
Chronological Fields:
	When the object was aquired/created (choose one)
	When the object was last modified
	When the object was last used
	When the database entry was last updated
Physical Data:
	Shape
	Mass
	Volume
	Center of Mass
	Materials
	Pigments
	Texture
	Weathering
Functional Fields:
	What type of object is this?
	What do you use it for?
	What are the results of using it?
	How important are those results?
Access Priority
	How often do you need to use it?
History
% Current Importance
Reason
	Why should you keep this?
	Does this interfere with other things?
	Will discarding this discomplete a system?
