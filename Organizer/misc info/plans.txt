List of bugs so far:
Region highlighting does not work
Scroll bar pop on an off needs accomodation
Truncated line display does not work
Double and triple clicking does not work

That is not okay.  What is the generality that links that?  "Do not break to the next line unless there is no room left on the current line."  Also, another bug found: word wrapping is unable to discount the width of spaces at the end of the line.  Perhaps this is really all one bug in the same.
