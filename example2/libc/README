This is a miniature and deliberately incomplte "libc" library for
simple Unix programs.  Originally, it started out as a very small
handful of C source code files, but for educational purposes, it was
broken out into multiple files more similar to the source code of
larger and more complete standard C library implementations.

Currently, there is only platform support for Linux kernel systems.
However, additional systems can easily be added by creating the proper
system call definitions for that particular platform.

If you're wondering why there are so many little files rather than a
few larger files, it's because static-linked libraries are generally
broken up so that there is one function per file.  The way the static
linker works is that it will search a static library for an object
code file containing the required function, and then include the
entire object code file in the link process.  By including only one
function per C source file, the number of extra functions brought in
during link time is minimized.  Thus, the total size of the resulting
executable file is also minimized.
