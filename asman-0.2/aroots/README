This directory is a placeholder for user configured archive roots.

The main idea: First you install the archive system by unpacking the
tarball and compiling the binaries in a chosen location on your host
machine, typically within some sort of user's home directory.  Next,
you copy the "template" directory to a different name within this
directory, and edit the files for your particular configuration.  If
you have multiple archive roots, you can go ahead and create multiple
such instances.

Now with your archive roots configured in this directory, it is simply
a matter of running make commands, etc.
