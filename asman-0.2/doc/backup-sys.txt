So what is everything that I need to do?

Here's how the system works:

You have a series of archive roots that files are backed-up under.
Files can be moved in or out of those archive roots, and files can be
moved around within the archive root.  All file moves should be
logged.  Files may also get modified without notice within a root.
Checksums will be used to check the integrity.

Now, a root may be mirrored across multiple devices or routed through
a device.  A root may also be routed through a root.  Roots may be
merged or split.  Roots can also be removed altogether.

You may also backup only a subset of one root to another.

Additional metadata may also be kept about the files.  That is beyond
the archive system.

There are two ways of tracking file changes within a root: modifying
an application or your operating system kernel so that file
modifications are tracked automatically, or searching for files
modified past a certain date.

Integrity checks may also be performed.

A journaling file manager is also needed.

Additionally, the checksums may also be used to guess moves/deletes.

Copychains are also supported for systems where hardlinks are not
supported.

Checksums alone may be stored on small or secure devices.  Do not use
md5; use sha256.

Create a backup chain optimizer.

Clear all the cross-fm-logs when the logs are cleared.

What if you skip standard routing?  Can you route in any order?

I also need a more robust way to separate site-local configuration
from the rest of the asman package.
